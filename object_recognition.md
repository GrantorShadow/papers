# Survey Of Object Recognition

The topics are as follows:

1. 2 Step Approaaches
2. Single Shot Approaches

2 step approaches can talk about R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster RCNN.
Then talk about innovations of each, slowly moving towards a fully convolutional model. Roi Pooling updated to R-FCN.

Meanwhile, YOLO , SSD providing a new way of doing things.

Also talk about convolutional bases and how they've evolved, inspiration from NLP solutions.

Finally newest solution is Retina Net, mask R-CNN. 

Newest verison of Yolo (v3) out. 

Tabulation of scores.

Author's perspective as to where the field is eventually going. The need for real time object recognition .

Faster,  more accurate. 

The roadblocks, class imbalance etc.
